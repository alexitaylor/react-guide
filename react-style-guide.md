# ⚛️ 💅 React Style Guide

## Background 
This guide is intended to help create an official style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring for React applications. Most of these rules adhere to Airbnb's style guide while also pulling from other well-known resources. As React is un-opinionated front-end UI library, this style guide aims to create a common convention to help developers write clean and maintainable code. The benefits of a style guide provides an ease for developers to come up to speed with a code base quickly and then write code that other developers can easily understand.
